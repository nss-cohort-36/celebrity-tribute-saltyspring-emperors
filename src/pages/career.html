                    <p>John Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, in Liverpool, England. He met Paul McCartney in 1957 and
                        invited McCartney to join his music group. They eventually formed the most successful
                        songwriting
                        partnership in musical history. Lennon left the Beatles in 1969 and later released albums with
                        his
                        wife, Yoko Ono, among others. On December 8, 1980, he was killed by a crazed fan named Mark
                        David
                        Chapman.</p>

                            <p>Lennon invited Ringo Starr and George Harrison to participate on a few of his solo
                                albums, but Paul McCartney never made the cut. While Lennon was in Los Angeles producing
                                a Harry Nilsson album, Paul and Linda McCartney dropped by the studio to say hi. It was
                                the reunion everybody wanted, but only those who stay up all night reading Wikipedia
                                know about. An impromptu jam session formed, which also included Stevie Wonder.
                                Surprisingly, Paul McCartney opted to sit in on drums, which happened to be Ringo’s set.
                                Recordings of the session have leaked and prove that the event was unfortunately very
                                unproductive. The title of the bootleg album containing these tracks is fittingly titled
                                A Toot and a Snore in ’74. The end of an era and no one even knew.</p>

                            <p>At some point in the ’70s, Lennon got chummy with David Bowie. The two really hit it off
                                and were hanging out in the studio when they decided they want to record a song. On the
                                spot, they co-wrote one of Bowie’s biggest hits, “Fame”. Around the same time, they
                                covered one of Lennon’s Beatles songs of which he had never been happy with the
                                recording. Hopefully, he enjoyed the opportunity to remake “Across the Universe” with
                                David Bowie.</p>
