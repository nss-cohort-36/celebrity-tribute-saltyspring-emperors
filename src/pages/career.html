                <p>John Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, in Liverpool, England. He met Paul McCartney in 1957 and
                    invited McCartney to join his music group. They eventually formed the most successful songwriting
                    partnership in musical history. Lennon left the Beatles in 1969 and later released albums with his
                    wife, Yoko Ono, among others. On December 8, 1980, he was killed by a crazed fan named Mark David
                    Chapman.</p>
